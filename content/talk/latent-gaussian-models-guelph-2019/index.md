summary: "Fit semi-parametric regression models to a variety of types of data using latent Gaussian models."
abstract: "I demonstrate how to fit semi-parametric regression models to a variety of types of data using latent Gaussian models. These models are highly general, easy to use and scale to massive data. I give an example on fitting a complicated model-based forecast (with uncertainty estimates) of opioid mortality rates in Canada and the US."
