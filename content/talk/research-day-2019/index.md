summary: "An explanation of why structured additive regression models are a compelling methodology to learn, with real-data applications."
abstract: "Structured additive regression models are a type of hierarchical regression model that can be used to do semi-parametric regression on a wide variety of different data types. When combined with Bayesian inference and modern computational tools they are very fast to fit and provide principled, model-based uncertainty estimates. Here they are applied to quantifying non-linear associations between age/time and mortality rates due to opioid-related causes of death in Canada and the US."
